Kivy Contest




This is our entry for the kivy contest.

The code is more or less a mess (as we got some huge timetroubles)

We created a small "educational" game to somehow teach some basic programming.

The goal of the game is to "program" a robot to collect all of those red things (not realy sure what they are supposed to be) and to not touch the green things.

The whole game is probably very confusing and not very educational at all. Actually we are not even sure whether it is possible to beat all the levels. Also it is very likely that there are tons of bugs and crashes within the application.
Anyhow we had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to build something with kivy.
